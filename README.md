# Robotics
## Overview
A Raspberry Pi robot written in Python and capable of waypoint navigation, place recognition and object-finding using Monte Carlo Localisation (MCL).

## Features
The robot is capable of performing the following tasks:
* Wall Following
* Waypoint Navigation ( using MCL )
* Place Recognition


## Hardware
The robot was created using the following hardware:
* Raspberry Pi
* BrickPi Hat
* Lego NXT sensors and actuators


## Final Task
Given three obstacles ( bottles ) and a known map of the environment, the robot is capable of locating these objects and bumping into them before returning to its starting position.This is done using MCL (for accuracy in navigation ) and sensors ( which can be rotated and hence "signature" ) for detecting an object as opposed to a wall ( which are already known since map of the environemnt is provided initially )
